================================

.. admonition:: Section Topic

   Create bespoke plans tailored to specific chores at the beamline. 

   Lesson
     Create plans composed of bluesky plan stubs which solve specific
     chores at the beamline.  The bespoke plans can be run at the bsui
     terminal or in a measurement plan in the same manner as the plan
     primitives.
